//   INT_CTL_ENABLE - Enables top-level interrupt sources to generate HW interrupts at the NIRQ pin. The three interrupt groups are Chip, Modem and Packet Handler. Each of them contains multiple possible interrupt sources that must be individually enabled via the INT_CTL_PH_ENABLE, INT_CTL_MODEM_ENABLE, INT_CTL_CHIP_ENABLE properties. Note that this property only provides for global enabling/disabling of the HW interrupt indication on the NIRQ output pin. An internal interrupt event may still be generated even if the indication on the NIRQ output pin is disabled. The interrupt event may always be monitored by polling a GPIO pin, or via GET_INT_STATUS, GET_CHIP_STATUS, GET_PH_STATUS, or GET_MODEM_STATUS commands.
//   INT_CTL_PH_ENABLE - Enable individual interrupt sources within the Packet Handler Interrupt Group in order to generate a HW interrupt at the NIRQ output pin. In order to fully enable a HW interrupt, it is necessary to enable both the individual interrupt source (within this property) as well as the corresponding interrupt group (e.g., set INT_CTL_ENABLE:PH_INT_STATUS_EN). Note that even if an interrupt source is not enabled to generate a HW NIRQ interrupt, the given interrupt event still may occur inside the chip and may be monitored by polling a GPIO pin, or via the GET_INT_STATUS or GET_PH_STATUS commands.
//   INT_CTL_MODEM_ENABLE - Enable individual interrupt sources within the Modem Interrupt Group in order to generate a HW interrupt at the NIRQ output pin. In order to fully enable a HW interrupt, it is necessary to enable both the individual interrupt source (within this property) as well as the corresponding interrupt group (e.g., set INT_CTL_ENABLE:MODEM_INT_STATUS_EN ). Note that even if an interrupt source is not enabled to generate a HW NIRQ interrupt, the given interrupt event still may occur inside the chip and may be monitored by polling a GPIO pin, or via the GET_INT_STATUS or GET_MODEM_STATUS commands.

// Descriptions:
//   PREAMBLE_TX_LENGTH - This property is used to configure the length of the Preamble field in TX mode for both Standard and Non-Standard Preambles. This property is not used by the chip in RX mode except when receiving a Non-Standard Preamble. In such a case, this property must be configured with the expected Preamble length (to provide an upper timeout limit on the Sync Word search algorithm). This property is only applicable in TX Packet Handler FIFO mode; if TX Direct Synchronous or TX Direct Asynchronous mode is selected (see MODEM_MOD_TYPE property), the entire transmission is obtained from a real-time TXDATA input stream on a GPIO pin and no automatic field construction is possible. The units of this property are in either nibbles or bytes, depending upon the value of PREAMBLE_CONFIG:LENGTH_CONFIG. Setting PREAMBLE_TX_LENGTH = 0x00 is a valid value, and will result in skipping transmission of the Preamble field; in such a case, the Sync Word will be the first transmitted field.
//   PREAMBLE_CONFIG_STD_1 - The fields in this property are applicable only in RX mode, and apply primarily to reception of Standard Preamble patterns (e.g., 1010 or 0101 patterns). However, see note on required configuration of RX_THRESH during reception of Non-Standard Preamble patterns.
//   PREAMBLE_CONFIG_NSTD - The fields in this property apply only to transmission and reception of packets with Non-Standard Preamble patterns (e.g., other than 1010 or 0101 patterns).
//   PREAMBLE_CONFIG_STD_2 - During initial reception and acquisition of a packet, it is often useful to define a timeout period to limit the amount of time the chip remains on-channel awaiting the incoming packet. This property allows configuration of this preamble search timeout period. If a valid preamble is not found within the specified timeout period, an INVALID_PREAMBLE event is generated and may be used to generate an interrupt and/or exit automatically from RX mode. The fields in this property are applicable only in RX mode, and only apply to reception of Standard Preamble patterns (e.g., 1010 or 0101 patterns). Detection of INVALID_PREAMBLE is not possible when configured to receive a Non-Standard Preamble pattern. Two different timeout configuration fields are provided to allow definition of timeout periods with significantly different lengths and bit resolution.
//   PREAMBLE_CONFIG - Miscellaneous preamble configuration bits.
//   PREAMBLE_PATTERN_31_24 - The PREAMBLE_PATTERN_XX properties define the pattern to be transmitted in TX mode and the pattern expected to be received in RX mode, but only when PREAMBLE_CONFIG:STANDARD_PREAM has been set to 0x0 (i.e., use Non-Standard Preamble). The PREAMBLE_PATTERN_XX properties are used to define the actual bit values describing the Non-Standard Preamble pattern; PREAMBLE_CONFIG_NSTD:PATTERN_LENGTH is used to define how many bits of the PREAMBLE_PATTERN_XX values are used. In TX mode, if the value of PREAMBLE_TX_LENGTH is larger than PREAMBLE_CONFIG_NSTD:PATTERN_LENGTH, the PREAMBLE_PATTERN will be transmitted repeatedly until the full number of bits has been sent. In RX mode, the full number of bits defined by PREAMBLE_CONFIG_NSTD:PATTERN_LENGTH must be received once before the PREAMBLE_VALID signal/interrupt is generated. If Manchester encoding/decoding is enabled, the values of the PREAMBLE_PATTERN_XX properties are expressed in chips (i.e., after Manchester encoding in TX mode, or before Manchester decoding in RX mode). The bits of the PREAMBLE_PATTERN_XX are always sent bits 0-31 time-wise (e.g., PREAMBLE_PATTERN_7_0 bit 0 is sent first).
//   PREAMBLE_PATTERN_23_16 - Bits 23-16 of the Non-Standard Preamble pattern to be transmitted or expected to be received. Please refer to the text description for PREAMBLE_PATTERN_31_24 for more details regarding the Non-Standard Preamble functionality.
//   PREAMBLE_PATTERN_15_8 - Bits 15-8 of the Non-Standard Preamble pattern to be transmitted or expected to be received. Please refer to the text description for PREAMBLE_PATTERN_31_24 for more details regarding the Non-Standard Preamble functionality.
//   PREAMBLE_PATTERN_7_0 - Bits 7-0 of the Non-Standard Preamble pattern to be transmitted or expected to be received. Please refer to the text description for PREAMBLE_PATTERN_31_24 for more details regarding the Non-Standard Preamble functionality.

//   PKT_LEN - This property configures the chip for reception of a variable length packet. This property is applicable only in RX mode, and only when the automatic Packet Handler is enabled (i.e., PKT_CONFIG1:PH_RX_DISABLE is cleared). If enabled, the extracted length can be retrieved using the PACKET_INFO command.
//   PKT_LEN_FIELD_SOURCE - This property configures the chip for reception of a variable length packet, and defines where the length field is in the packet. The packet length byte(s) must be the last byte(s) in a fixed length field and must precede the variable length field. This property is applicable only in RX mode, and only when the automatic Packet Handler is enabled (i.e., the PH_RX_DISABLE bit in the PKT_CONFIG1 property is cleared).
//   PKT_LEN_ADJUST - It is possible to define the total length of a packet in a variety of ways (e.g., including/excluding the packet length bytes, including/excluding the CRC bytes, etc.) This property provides a means of adjusting/offsetting the received packet length value in order to comply with a wide range of packet length implementations. This property is applicable only in RX mode, and only when the automatic Packet Handler is enabled (i.e., the PH_RX_DISABLE bit in the PKT_CONFIG1 property is cleared). The value of the LEN_ADJUST field is added to the received value of the packet length byte(s), extracted from the field specified by the SRC_FIELD value in the PKT_LEN_FIELD_SOURCE property. The resulting value is then used to configure the length of the variable length field specified by PKT_LEN:DST_FIELD. The required constant value of the LEN_ADJUST field is typically defined in a protocol specification or regulatory standard, or can be derived from the specification. The default processing mode of the chip is that the received packet length value does NOT include the packet length bytes, and does NOT include CRC bytes. In such a case, the LEN_ADJUST field should be set to 0x00. If the received packet length value includes the packet length bytes and/or the CRC bytes, its effective value must be reduced by adding a negative offset. In such a case, the LEN_ADJUST field should be set to the negative value of the extra byte count (in 2's complement format). Example: the transmitted packet has a 2-byte packet length field followed by a 10-byte Payload field, and the value contained in the packet length bytes = 0x000C = 12 bytes. The value of LEN_ADJUST should be set = 0xFE = -2. The LEN_ADJUST field is a signed value.

// Descriptions:
//   MODEM_CHFLT_RX1_CHFLT_COE13_7_0 - The chip implements the RX channel selection bandpass filtering in the digital domain as an FIR filter. The MODEM_CHFLT_RX_CHFLT_COEXX properties define the values for the filter tap coefficients. The chip provides for two different sets of RX filter coefficients (MODEM_CHFLT_RX1 and MODEM_CHFLT_RX2). These properties define the values for the first set of filter coefficients; see also the text description for the MODEM_CHFLT_RX2_CHFLT_COEXX properties for a discussion of the second set of filter coefficients and use of adaptive RX filter bandwidth across the packet. By default, the digital filter is 27 taps in length. However, it is possible to configure the RX Modem for a channel selection filter with only 15 taps; the advantage of the 15-tap filter is a reduction in filter processing delay at the expense of reduced filtering performance (e.g., adjacent channel selectivity). Please contact Silicon Labs for assistance with configuring the reduced performance filter. The values of the tap coefficients are symmetrical; that is, the value of COEFF26=COEFF0, COEFF25=COEFF1, and so on. Thus it is only necessary to store 14 filter coefficients; the internal circuitry obtains the remaining coefficients through symmetry. Each filter tap coefficient is a 10-bit signed value. The lower 8-bits of each coefficient are held in the MODEM_CHFLT_RX1_CHFLT_COEXX properties; the top two bits are packed into the MODEM_CHFLT_RX1_CHFLT_COEMXX properties. Silicon Labs has pre-calculated 15 different sets of filter tap coefficients. The WDS Calculator will recommend one of these filter sets, based upon the RX filter bandwidth required to receive the desired signal. The filter bandwidth is a function of both the selected filter set, as well as the filter clock decimation ratio (see the MODEM_DECIMATION_CFG1/0 properties). This property sets the lower 8-bits of the 13th filter coefficient for the first set of filter coefficients; the top two bits are packed into the MODEM_CHFLT_RX1_CHFLT_COEM0 property.

//   MODEM_CHFLT_RX2_CHFLT_COE13_7_0 - The chip provides for two different sets of RX filter coefficients (MODEM_CHFLT_RX1 and MODEM_CHFLT_RX2). These properties define the values for the second set of filter coefficients; see also the text description for the MODEM_CHFLT_RX1_CHFLT_COEXX properties for a general discussion of the configuration of filter tap coefficients. Two different sets of filter tap coefficients (i.e., filter bandwidths) are provided to allow narrowing the RX bandwidth after the PLL-based AFC algorithm has acquired the signal and centered it in the filter passband. With no residual frequency error, the filter bandwidth may be reduced to pass only the modulation bandwidth of the signal, thus improving sensitivity over the remainder of the packet. This adaptive RX bandwidth feature is only applicable when PLL AFC is enabled (by setting MODEM_AFC_MISC:ENFBPLL), and the adaptive RX bandwidth function is enabled (by setting MODEM_AFC_GAIN_1:AFCBD). When the adaptive RX bandwidth feature is enabled, the first set of filter coefficients (defined in the MODEM_CHFLT_RX1 properties) is effective prior to gear-switching (e.g., detection of PREAMBLE_VALID) while the second set of filter coefficients (defined in the MODEM_CHFLT_RX2 properties) is effective after gear-switching. When the adaptive RX bandwidth feature is disabled, the first set of filter coefficients is used for the entire packet. This property sets the lower 8-bits of the 13th filter coefficient for the second set of filter coefficients; the top two bits are packed into the MODEM_CHFLT_RX2_CHFLT_COEM0 property.

// Descriptions:
//   SYNTH_PFDCP_CPFF - The charge pump and loop filter in the PLL Synthesizer have two paths: an integral path and a feed-forward path. This property adjusts the charge pump gain (i.e., current) for the feed-forward path. The coding of the MSB (bit 5) of the CP_FF_CUR field is inverted. As a result, the minimum charge pump gain setting is obtained for a value of CP_FF_CUR=0x20, while CP_FF_CUR=0x00 corresponds to a mid-range charge pump gain setting and 0x1F corresponds to the maximum charge pump gain setting. The step size or resolution of the charge pump feed-forward current is in increments of 5 uA. Thus the range of values provided by the CP_FF_CUR field is from 0 uA to 315 uA. CP_FF_CUR_TEST is a test bit and is not recommended for general customer applications. The CP_FF_CUR_TEST bit is not binary-weighted with the CP_FF_CUR field but instead provides an additional 160 uA, when set. NOTE: the primary purpose of the SYNTH group of properties is to adjust the PLL loop bandwidth to a value appropriate for the selected data rate. Silicon Labs does not recommend modifying these properties away from the values suggested by the WDS Calculator.
//   SYNTH_PFDCP_CPINT - The charge pump and loop filter in the PLL Synthesizer have two paths: an integral path and a feed-forward path. This property adjusts the charge pump gain (i.e., current) for the integral path. The coding of the MSB (bit 3) of the CP_INT_CUR field is inverted. As a result, the minimum charge pump gain setting is obtained for a value of CP_INT_CUR=0x08, while CP_INT_CUR=0x00 corresponds to a mid-range charge pump gain setting and 0x07 corresponds to the maximum charge pump gain setting. The step size or resolution of the charge pump feed-forward current is in increments of 5 uA. Thus the range of values provided by the CP_INT_CUR field is from 0 uA to 75 uA. NOTE: the primary purpose of the SYNTH group of properties is to adjust the PLL loop bandwidth to a value appropriate for the selected data rate. Silicon Labs does not recommend modifying these properties away from the values suggested by the WDS Calculator.
//   SYNTH_VCO_KV - The charge pump, loop filter, and VCO tuning varactors in the PLL Synthesizer have two paths: an integral path and a feed-forward path. This property adjusts the gain scaling factors (Kv) for the tuning varactors in both the integral path and the feed-forward path. The adjustment of the gain factors is accomplished internally by switching in different number of varactor devices. NOTE: the primary purpose of the SYNTH group of properties is to adjust the PLL loop bandwidth to a value appropriate for the selected data rate. Silicon Labs does not recommend modifying these properties away from the values suggested by the WDS Calculator.
//   SYNTH_LPFILT3 - The loop filter in the feed-forward path contains three lowpass filter poles: R1-C1, R2-C2, and R3-C3. The LPF_FF_R2 field adjusts the value of resistor R2, and thus adjusts the cutoff frequency of the R2-C2 lowpass filter pole. Additionally, the resistor R2 affects the DC gain of the transistor Gm stage in the feed-forward path. Increasing the value of R2 has the effect of increasing the feed-forward path gain. The value of R2 is in increments of 18 kOhm, ranging from a minimum value of 18 kOhm to a maximum of 144 kOhm. NOTE: the primary purpose of the SYNTH group of properties is to adjust the PLL loop bandwidth to a value appropriate for the selected data rate. Silicon Labs does not recommend modifying these properties away from the values suggested by the WDS Calculator.
//   SYNTH_LPFILT2 - The loop filter in the feed-forward path contains three lowpass filter poles: R1-C1, R2-C2, and R3-C3. The LPF_FF_C2 field adjusts the value of capacitor C2, and thus adjusts the cutoff frequency of the R2-C2 lowpass filter pole. The value of C2 is in increments of 335 fF, ranging from a minimum value of 877 fF to a maximum of 11.25 pF. NOTE: the primary purpose of the SYNTH group of properties is to adjust the PLL loop bandwidth to a value appropriate for the selected data rate. Silicon Labs does not recommend modifying these properties away from the values suggested by the WDS Calculator.
//   SYNTH_LPFILT1 - The loop filter in the feed-forward path contains three lowpass filter poles: R1-C1, R2-C2, and R3-C3. The LPF_FF_C3 field adjusts the value of capacitor C3, and thus adjusts the cutoff frequency of the R3-C3 lowpass filter pole. The value of resistor R3 is not adjustable and is fixed at R3=3.94 kOhm. The value of C3 is in increments of 1 pF, ranging from a minimum value of 9 pF to a maximum of 12 pF. The total value of capacitor C1 is determined by a 3-bit binary-weighted field LPF_FF_C1 in increments of 380 fF, and a 2-bit offset field LPF_FF_C1_CODE in increments of 1 pF, plus an additional fixed capacitance of 4.55 pF. Thus the total value of capacitor C1 may be described by the following equation: C1 = 4.55pF + 380fF*LPF_FF_C1 + 1pF*LPF_FF_C1_CODE The value of resistor R1 is not adjustable and is fixed at R1=9.86 kOhm. NOTE: the primary purpose of the SYNTH group of properties is to adjust the PLL loop bandwidth to a value appropriate for the selected data rate. Silicon Labs does not recommend modifying these properties away from the values suggested by the WDS Calculator.
//   SYNTH_LPFILT0 - Bias current of the loop filter, 25 uA, 34 uA, 50 uA or 100 uA.

//   FREQ_CONTROL_INTE - The total divide ratio for the Fractional-N PLL Synthesizer consists of an integer portion and a fractional portion. This property defines the integer divide number; the fractional divide value is specified in properties FREQ_CONTROL_FRAC_2, FREQ_CONTROL_FRAC_1, and FREQ_CONTROL_FRAC_0. The formula for calculating RF channel frequency as a function of integer and fractional divide values is as follows: The output divider value OUTDIV is configured as a function of the desired frequency band, and is specified in property MODEM_CLKGEN_BAND:BAND. The entire FC_FRAC word is 20-bits in length, but the MSB should always be set to 1, and thus the term FC_FRAC/2^19 will always be between 1 and 2 in value. As a result, the integer term FC_INTE should be reduced by 1. Example: a total desired divide ratio of N = 60.135 should be implemented as FC_INTE = 59, FC_FRAC/2^19 = 1.135. Modifying this property will have no effect until the chip exits from TX or RX state, and then re-enters the state.
//   FREQ_CONTROL_FRAC_2 - Please refer to the text description for FREQ_CONTROL_INTE for more details regarding frequency calculation.
//   FREQ_CONTROL_FRAC_1 - Please refer to the text description for FREQ_CONTROL_INTE for more details regarding frequency calculation.
//   FREQ_CONTROL_FRAC_0 - Please refer to the text description for FREQ_CONTROL_INTE for more details regarding frequency calculation.
//   FREQ_CONTROL_CHANNEL_STEP_SIZE_1 - The EZ Frequency Programming method allows the user to control the frequency by selecting a desired channel number, given a base frequency and a channel step size. This property defines Byte 1 of the unsigned 16-bit channel step size value. The units of the FREQ_CONTROL_CHANNEL_STEP_SIZE_1/0 property are in increments of the LSB tuning resolution of the PLL Synthesizer, and are therefore a function of the crystal reference frequency and output frequency band. The formula for calculating the value of the FREQ_CONTROL_CHANNEL_STEP_SIZE property is given by the following equation: The base frequency is specified by the FREQ_CONTROL_INTE and FREQ_CONTROL_FRAC_2/1/0 properties. The channel number is specified by the CHANNEL parameter byte passed to the START_TX command. The commanded channel frequency is given by the formula:
//   FREQ_CONTROL_CHANNEL_STEP_SIZE_0 - The EZ Frequency Programming method allows the user to control the frequency by selecting a desired channel number, given a base frequency and a channel step size. This property defines Byte 0 of the unsigned 16-bit channel step size value. Please refer to the text description for FREQ_CONTROL_CHANNEL_STEP_SIZE_1 for more details regarding the channel step size function.
//   FREQ_CONTROL_W_SIZE - The chip performs a calibration of the VCO at each new commanded frequency. This is accomplished by counting cycles of the VCO frequency and comparing to an expected target count value. The length of the window during which cycles of the VCO frequency are counted is specified by this property. The units are in cycles of the crystal reference frequency (e.g., 30 MHz clock periods). This property does not need to change as a function of crystal reference frequency; the chip automatically calculates the target VCO count value as a function of crystal reference frequency and thus this property may remain constant. Silicon Labs recommends setting this property always to 0x20.
//   FREQ_CONTROL_VCOCNT_RX_ADJ - The chip performs a calibration of the VCO at each new commanded frequency. This is accomplished by counting cycles of the VCO frequency and comparing to an expected target count value. As the chip's default mode of operation uses a low-IF architecture with low-side Mixer injection, the RX LO must shift downwards in frequency during RX mode. The expected target count value changes as a result of this shift in frequency. This field is a signed value that represents the amount by which the target count value must be adjusted in RX mode.
